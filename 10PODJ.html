                            <p>“We do not live single issue lives” –Audre Lorde. Ableism, coupled with
                                white supremacy, supported by capitalism, underscored by
                                heteropatriarchy, has rendered the vast majority of the world “invalid.” (Sins Invalid, 2015).
                                
                                This principle employs Kimberle Crenshaw’s Intersectionality to critically analyze the experiences of people with disabilities. In other words they use this to explain the intersecting oppression they face for being disabled along with their other marginalized identities such as race, class, sexuality, age etc.

                                They are elevating, listening to, reading, following, and highlighting the perspectives of those who are most impacted by the systems they fight against when they discuss ableism, racism, sexism and transmisogyny, colonization, police violence, etc. They are not relying on academics and experts to tell them what's what. By emphasizing the leadership of those who will be most affected, they remain grounded in current issues and develop innovative methods of resistance.

                            <p>In an economy that sees land and humans as components of profit, we
                                are anti-capitalist by the nature of having non-conforming body/minds. (Sins Invalid, 2015).
                                
                                Due to the nature of their physical and mental impairments, they are unable to achieve "normative" levels of productivity in a capitalist society, and as a result, their labor is frequently overlooked by a system that defines it in terms of able-bodied, white supremacist, and gender normative standards. Their value is independent of what they can produce and how much of it.

                            <p>Shifting how social justice movements understand disability and 
                                contextualize ableism, disability justice lends itself to politics of alliance. (Sins Invalid, 2015).
                                
                                Disability justice must collaborate with movements for racial justice, reproductive justice, queer and trans liberation, prison abolition, environmental justice, anti-police terror, Deaf activism, fat liberation, and other forms of justice and liberation in order to reach its full potential as a movement. This calls for addressing ableism-related racism in other movements as well as in communities of white people with disabilities. They develop a cohesive front by working together across several movements.

                                Everybody has a rich history and a rich life. Every individual has an interior experience made up of their unique thoughts, feelings, emotions, sexual desires, perceptions, and eccentricities. The disabled are complete human beings.

                                We take a ground-up approach in identifying the needs of the disability community on our campus. We move away from the urgency of quotas, and our “progress” is marked by the ongoing development of our community-building efforts. Our student leadership makes every effort to enact principles of patience, flexibility, and care, that honors the ways that our capacities may fluctuate over time.

                                For the liberation of our community, we offer care and support for each other.
